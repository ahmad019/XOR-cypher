Exclusive OR Cipher text program in python

>This program takes text input and an 8bit cipher key to apply XOR logic operator on the ASCII code of the text to cipher the message. 

>To decrypt the message, copy the cipher text and input it again into the program. If the key is same, the text will be decrypted.

>Decryption cannot be performed unless the key is acquired.
